freeShop has new music playback settings. It can play music directly from eShop's extdata or using user-provided audio files. Format support will be **BCSTM** (DSP ADPCM), **Ogg** (Vorbis), and basic **AAC**. It is recommended that you use BCSTM format. There is a great community for music in this format found here: [http://smashcustommusic.com/](http://smashcustommusic.com/)

Will be available for testing within a couple days.

### New Music Directory

The new directory for audio files will be **sd:/3ds/data/freeShop/music/**. There is no support for subdirectories currently, so only the files directly there will be usable.

You will notice an **/eshop/** subdirectory there, but you should just leave it alone. That will have eShop audio files, and it will be auto-created if you try to remove it.
